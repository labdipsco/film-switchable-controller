<title>USB-Controlled Switchable Film</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>USB-Controlled Switchable Film for Experimental Applications</h1>
<p>This is a simple Arduino-based application that allows USB serial control of a <strong>switchable film</strong> (also known as <strong>smart film</strong> or <strong>PDLC film</strong>). A switchable film is a special type of material that can switch between transparent and opaque states when an electrical signal is applied.</p>
<p>By using an <strong>Arduino board</strong> and a <strong>relay module</strong>, the smart film can be controlled from a computer via a serial connection. You can send simple commands from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python scripts</li>
<li>Experimental software like <strong>OpenSesame</strong>, <strong>PsychoPy</strong>, <strong>E-Prime</strong></li>
<li>MATLAB or other serial-enabled platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup is ideal for labs conducting <strong>psychological</strong>, <strong>visual perception</strong>, or <strong>timing-sensitive</strong> experiments, where automated control of visual stimuli is required.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>üõ†Ô∏è How it works</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Arduino listens for serial commands via USB.</li>
<li>When a command is received (e.g., <code>'o'</code> to turn the film on, <code>'c'</code> to turn it off), it activates a relay. Timed control is also possible.</li>
<li>The relay controls the AC power to the switchable film (typically 45/60V AC depending on the film).</li>
<li>Commands can be triggered programmatically from experimental software.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üîß Hardware Requirements</h2>
<p>To build this system, you'll need the following components:</p>
<h3>1. Arduino UNO R4 Minima</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>USB Interface</strong>: USB-C connector
For more details, refer to the <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-r4-minima/">Arduino UNO R4 Minima Documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Relay Shield for Arduino UNO or an Arduino compatible relay</h3>
<p>This shield allows the Arduino to control high-power loads up to 120V AC/3A. The relay connected to the switchable film is controlled from arduino pin 7 at 5V.
For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/4-relays-shield/4-relay-shield-basics/">Arduino 4 Relays Shield Basics</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Switchable Film (Smart Film)</h3>
<p>The switchable film used in this project was kindly provided by <a href="https://www.innoptec.com">Innoptec</a>. This film changes its transparency state when an electrical voltage is applied, making it ideal for applications requiring controlled light transmission.
<em>Note</em>: The film requires an appropriate AC power supply (typically 45 or 60V/50Hz AC) and should be handled with care, ensuring all safety precautions are followed.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Ensure all components are properly connected and insulated to maintain safety and functionality. Always consult the respective datasheets and user manuals for detailed information and guidelines.</p>

<h2>üì° Install</h2>
<p>Download <a href="https://github.com/labdipsco/film-switchable-controller/blob/main/controller.ino">controller.ino</a>,compile and upload to Arduino Uno with <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/">Arduino IDE</a></p>
<hr/>
<h2>üì° Serial Command Reference</h2>
<p>The values listed in the table are sent to Arduino to control the switchable film.</p>
<p>| Command      | Description                                                        |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <code>o</code>          | Activate the film (make it opaque)                                 |
| <code>c</code>          | Deactivate the film (make it transparent)                          |
| <code>O&lt;time in ms&gt;E</code>     | Activate, then deactivate after delay (e.g., <code>O2000E</code>)     |
| <code>C&lt;time in ms&gt;E</code>     | Deactivate, then activate after delay (e.g., <code>C2400E</code>)     |</p>
<h2>üì° Simple code for Send command to Arduino with Python and Matlab</h2>
<p>```python
import serial
import time</p>
<h1>Define the command to send</h1>
<p>command = "O60000E"</p>
<h1>Check which COM port is correct for your device on your system (e.g., COM3, COM4, etc.)</h1>
<p>ser = serial.Serial('COM3', baudrate=115200, timeout=1)
ser.write(command.encode('utf-8'))
ser.close()
```</p>
<p>Matlab
```matlab
% Define the command to send
command = 'O15000E';
% Check which COM port is correct for your device on your system (e.g., COM3, COM4, etc.)
s = serialport("COM3", 115200);  % Adjust port name and baud rate as needed
write(s, command, "string");
clear s;</p>

<h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The switchable film operates with <strong>AC power</strong> and must be handled with <strong>extreme caution</strong>.</li>
<li>Always use a <strong>relay module with proper galvanic isolation</strong> between the Arduino (low-voltage side) and the high-voltage AC circuit connected to the film.</li>
<li>Never connect high voltage directly to the Arduino or to your computer.</li>
<li>The entire apparatus (relay module, AC driver, wiring, and switchable film) must be <strong>adequately insulated and enclosed</strong> to prevent accidental contact with live components.</li>
<li>Ensure that all connections comply with <strong>electrical safety standards</strong>, and avoid handling the system when powered unless it is fully enclosed and safe.</li>
<li>If you are not familiar with working with mains voltage (e.g., 220V AC), consult a qualified technician before proceeding.</li>
</ul>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>High voltage can cause serious injury or death</strong>. This project is intended for educational or laboratory use by individuals with adequate knowledge of electrical safety.</p>
